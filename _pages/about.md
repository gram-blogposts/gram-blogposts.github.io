### GRAM Workshop @ ICML 2024

The Geometric-Grounded Representation Learning and Generative Modelling [GRaM](https://gram-workshop.github.io/) workshop aims to provide a platform that fosters learning, collaboration, and the advancement of the geometry-grounded methods in machine learning. **In this Blogpost-Tutorial track**, we intend to encourage transparent discussions and opinions in the field, and make geometric machine learning more accessible. 

This blogpost track is directly inspired by the amazing [ICLR blogpost track](https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/). :heart:

We are pleased to announce the **blogposts and tutorials accepted** at our workshop!

### This is just the beginning!
**Do you feel like writting a blogpost or a tutorial that is linked with geometry?** We would love to host you! 

Check our [instructions](/instructions/) to submit your blogpost as a pull request. You can also write a [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebook. Don't forget to ping our GRaM co-organiser: alison.pouplin &#91;&#97;&#116;&#93; aalto &#91;&#100;&#111;&#116;&#93; fi :cherry_blossom:



<!-- The format and process for this blog post track is as follows:

- The post can be written on any subject linked to the [GRaM workshop](https://gram-workshop.github.io/). It can offer insights on certain aspects of the field, list a series of open problems, explain mathematical concepts in a pedagogical way, or discuss a research paper.

- The blogs will be peer-reviewed in a double-blind way. To be accepted, submissions must meet criteria such as content quality and novelty, clear and pedagogical presentation, new insights in theory or practice, and reproducibility or enhancement of experiments.

- The posts will be hosted on this website.

Note that the submission, reviewing and publication process of the blogposts are directly inspired by the [ICLR track](https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/). See the [instruction page]({{ '/instructions/'}}) for detailed instructions. -->
