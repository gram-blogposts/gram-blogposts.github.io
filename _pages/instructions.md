### Submission Process

1. **Fork and Rename**: Start by forking the staging repository (link to be provided). Rename your fork to reflect your submission's topic.
2. **Setup and Deployment**: Follow the deployment instructions in the `README` carefully, editing the `_config.yml` as required.
3. **Preparing Your Submission**: Place your blog post in the `_posts` directory. Accompanying media should go into a new folder within assets, named after your repository. Avoid including any identifying information.
4. **Finalizing Submission**: Remove all personal identifiers from your blog post content. Submit a pull request to the staging repository. Provide the blog post title and URL via our OpenReview system (link to be provided).

### Review and Publication

- **Review**: Reviewers will assess only the live content of the blog. They are expected to avoid probing into the repository's historical data to maintain anonymity.
- **Camera-Ready Submission**: Upon acceptance, add your identifying information to the post. Submit a final pull request to the main repository for integration into the official blog. Track chairs may request additional edits before final approval.

### Key Reminders

- Ensure your pull requests only modify the specified files (`_config.yml`, your post, and assets).
- Report any issues during setup or submission promptly to ensure they do not affect your review process.
- The authors can host their posts on their own GitHub repositories, aligning with common double-blind practices similar to pre-publishing on arXiv.
